Are you chatting too much? Use this handy plugin for BetterDiscord to block it!

## What?
This plugin injects a code to disable the chat interface and blurs your name too. Useful for some very specific cases.

## Why?
I made this to prevent myself from accidentally talking on a specific account. 

## How?
This uses CSS to hide certain elements without breaking too many features. This could break when it inevitably updates, but eh. Who cares.
